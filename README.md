# <p align="center">BRANCHED</p>

Branched is a Fabric add-on mod for *[Lush](https://github.com/yurisuika/Lush)* that adds trunk, branch, and twig blocks (and their stripped versions) for every species to give you more realistic trees. No longer does every tree just have a boring thick trunk!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/branched.git

cd ./branched

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
